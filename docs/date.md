## isoDateFromDateInput

The `govukDateInput` component stores separate values for `day`, `month` and `year` values.

When prefixed using a `namePrefix`, these values are stored with names prefixed with that value. This filter takes these prefixed values and converts them into an ISO 8601 formatted date.

Input

```js
const data = {
  `dob-day`: '01',
  `dob-month`: '02',
  `dob-year`: '2012',
}
```

```njk
{{ data | isoDateFromDateInput("dob") }}
```

Output

```html
2012-02-01
```

Combine this filter with `govukDate` to output a human readable date:

```njk
{{ data | isoDateFromDateInput("dob") | govukDate }}
```

```html
1 February 2012
```

It’s possible to configure `govukDateInput` so that only certain parts of a date are asked for, such as a month and year. You can also omit the `namePrefix` option and use individual `name` options for each value if you want to save them in a nested object. This filter also covers that use case:

```js
const data = {
  passport: {
    month: '5',
    year: '2001',
  }
}
```

```njk
{{ data.passport | isoDateFromDateInput }}
```

Output

```html
2001-05
```

## monthName

Convert a number (between 1 and 12) to the name of the corresponding month.

Input

```njk
{{ 3 | monthName }}
```

Output

```html
March
```

You can also output a truncated month name:

Input

```njk
{{ 3 | monthName("truncate") }}
```

Output

```html
Mar
```
